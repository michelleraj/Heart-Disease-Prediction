# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Using a dataset of patient health records, a predictive model was developed using pandas which accurately identified risk factors for heart disease and generated insights


## 1. Correlation Matrix - the relationship between variables in the data set

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis Heart Disease vs Gender
Heart Disease is most commonly found in Males relative to females
Females that have heart disease are less than the ones who don't have heart disease

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis for different ECGs compared to heart failure

# BOX Plots

Box plots visually show the distribution of numerical data and skewness by displaying the data quartiles (or percentiles) and averages

box plot consists of a rectangular box that represents the interquartile range (IQR), spanning from the first quartile to the third quartile. Inside the box, a line marks the median, while extending from the box are "whiskers" that indicate the positions of the minimum and maximum values.

Box plots are a useful way to visualize differences among different samples or groups. They manage to provide a lot of statistical information, including â€” medians, ranges, and outliers

Compare the respective medians of each box plot. If the median line of a box plot lies outside of the box of a comparison box plot, then there is likely to be a difference between the two groups.

Compare the interquartile ranges (that is, the box lengths), to examine how the data is dispersed between each sample. The longer the box the more dispersed the data. The smaller the less dispersed the data.
